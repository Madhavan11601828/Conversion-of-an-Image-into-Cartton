# Conversion-of-an-Image-into-Cartoon
This report presents the process of generating a cartoonification from the image using Python and Opencv

#### OpenCV
Python is a strong collection of effective libraries. It has many libraries for practical applications in the real world aspects. OpenCV is one such library. OpenCV is a computer vision multi-platform library. It involves video and image capture and editing applications. It is utilized in several incredible utilizations that including image transformation, shape identification, facial recognition and many others.

#### Objective
The goal of this project is to transform an image into a cartoon. Building a python application that will convert an image into a corresponding cartoon using openCV.

### Steps involved in developing Cartoonifier Application

#### Step-1: Importing the required libraries

- CV2 library - Imported to utilize OpenCV for the aspects of image processing [CV2](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) [CV2 Tools](https://pypi.org/project/cv2-tools/) [OpenCV Tutorials](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_image_display/py_image_display.html) [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/)
- EASYGUI library - Imported for opening a file box. It will allow the user to select any file from the user's system. [EASYGUI](https://pypi.org/project/easygui/#:~:text=EasyGUI%20is%20a%20module%20for,invoked%20by%20simple%20function%20calls.) [EASYGUI Documents](https://easygui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- NUMPY - Images will be stored and processed as numbers. These are taken as arrays. Usually, everyone utilize NUMPY to deal with arrays. [NUMPY](https://numpy.org/) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy)
- IMAGEIO - Imported for reading the file that is selected by file box along with the path od the image. [IMAGEIO](https://pypi.org/project/imageio/) [IMAGEIO Documents](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- MATPLOTLIB - Imported for the purpose of visualization and plotting. In this aspect, It is imported to plot the images. [MATPLOTLIB](https://matplotlib.org/) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib)
- OS - Imported for the OS interaction. The main purpose of this library is to read the path and save the selected images to that path. [OS](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
- TKINTER - It is an GUI toolkit. It is imported for generation of GUI(Graphical User Interface). [TKINTER](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter)
- PIL - The full form of PIL is "Python Image Library". It is a free open source additional library for python programming language that adds support for opening, Manipulating and Saving various image file formats.
